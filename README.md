# AmazonOfferIdGatherer
Console application to capture offer id's for a given sku.

If you know how to compile code feel free to review what I've written and compile on your own.

For everyone else, take the zip file under releases, unzip to a folder anywhere and run the exe file.

All you need to do is enter an amazon sku, currently running a 5000ms delay.  This will use your local ip address to ping amazon.

The offer Id's will only be grabbed for products that are "sold by amazon", no 3rd party vendors, and no used items.

The console application will be written to the actaul console application window on your screen, it will also be sent in a webhook
to a discord lobby I have.  Feel free to post in HOC and I will be updating the master gpu list as well.
